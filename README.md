## To Do

* read all the inspirations and find things to adopt
* update plugins
* review folder structure
* test
* distribute as Arch package
* what can i lazy load? start from: https://github.com/stevearc/conform.nvim/blob/master/doc/recipes.md#lazy-loading-with-lazynvim
* use "event", "keys", "cmd", "opts", "init" from lazy.nvim (see the conform conf)
